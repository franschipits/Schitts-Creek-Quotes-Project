# Schitts Creek Quotes Generator.
This web application is a quote generator for the television series `Schitts Creek`, developed utilizing `Python` and `Flask`. Inspired by a deep appreciation for the show and its memorable quotes, I made this project with the dual purpose of commemorating its iconic dialogues and fostering enjoyment for fellow enthusiasts.
